One very tricky scraper, mainly because the target website (doTERRA) is highly dynamic in the way the navigation through the menus works and in the way the contents are loaded. At least, the website didn't show any sort of countermeasures.

__IMPORTANT:__
1. The scraper was built and tested with Python 3.9.6.
2. Edge browser was chosen. _Edge v119.0.2151.44_ was used together with _msgedgedriver.exe v119.0.2151.44_ that can be — gladly — found on __/components/msgedgedriver.exe__.
3. The scraper will only work properly when connected to a Portugal VPN.
